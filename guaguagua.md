# Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and FileSystem
this page shows the results of giving a terminal different commands with different circumstances. In these cases a directory named "Lecture1" exists with multiple directories and files within these directories. 
# cd
## Example with no arguments: 
```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$ []
```
With no arguments the cd command will set your terminal to not be inside of any directory.
This is because the cd command requires a directory to open, otherwise it defaults back to the beggining with no directory open.
This output is NOT an error.

## Example with a path to a directory as an argument:
```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd lecture1
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ []
