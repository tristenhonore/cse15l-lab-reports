# Heading 1 Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and FileSystem
## Heading 2 cd
No arguments: 
```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$ 
```
With no arguments the cd command will set your terminal to not be inside of any directory.
This is because the cd command requires a directory to open, otherwise it defaults back to the beggining with no directory open.
This output is NOT an error.
