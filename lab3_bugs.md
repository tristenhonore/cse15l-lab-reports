# Debugging
the following code is a method that, in its current state, does not work as intended.:
```
  // Averages the numbers in the array (takes the mean), but leaves out the
  // lowest number when calculating. Returns 0 if there are no elements or just
  // 1 element in the array
  static double averageWithoutLowest(double[] arr) {
    if(arr.length < 2) { return 0.0; }
    double lowest = arr[0];
    for(double num: arr) {
      if(num < lowest) { lowest = num; }
    }
    double sum = 0;
    for(double num: arr) {
      if(num != lowest) { sum += num; }
    }
    return sum / (arr.length - 1);
  }
```

## [Diagnosing]()
we can see the code and its purpose, now lets attempt to run it with different inputs.
