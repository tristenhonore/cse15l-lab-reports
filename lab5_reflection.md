# Reflection on CSE 15L

In 15L I have learned so much that It would take a lot of writing to explain but my personal favorite has been the use of scripts
and different commands within the scripts. I've found writing scripts to be a short task that becomes extremely valuable for longer 
assignments that require constant testing. I've also found its relation to the autograder to be informative and makes me respect
the grading process more. I've also enjoyed some of the commands like `rm -rf`, `mkdir`, `touch`. Overall I find it fun to make scripts
and use them, it makes me feel like a professional.
