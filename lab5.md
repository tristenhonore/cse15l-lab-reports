# Lab 5: Putting it All Together
In this lab we will show a hypothetical conversation between a TA and a student who is having issues with a program. The situation is not a replication 
of a real event and none of the names are references to any real people. In addition there will be a reflection of a topic I learned from the second half of CSE 15L.
