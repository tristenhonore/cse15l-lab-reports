In this image you can see the use of the url in order to send a message along with you username into the website. The code takes the url and splits it into two parts at the "&", then splits the two parts at the "=". The results are placed into two arrays, one for usernames and the other for messages. Within in both arrays the items at index 0 are the parts on the left of the "=" and the index 1 is the right side. We take the items at index 1 and use them as arsguments so we can format them as <user>: <message> and return this result. We also add this result to a String called "Chatlogs" that takes this same format and puts a "\n" so that all messages are placed on a new line.
