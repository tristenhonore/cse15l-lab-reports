# Step 6 Committ and Push Change
Finally, we are going to run these three commands in order: `git add .` , `git commmit -m yippee` , `git push origin main` .  
`git add .` will set us up for commiting changes in the directory.  
`git commit -m yippe` will commit the changes and "yippee" will be the commit message that you will be able to see in github.  
`git push origin main` will push the committed change into the actual github site.

We have now demonstrated how Vim can be used in order to change code and other files while remotely accessing a server.
